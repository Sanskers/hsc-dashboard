    <h1>Hardcore Survivor Challenge Rules</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>Credit for this ruleset goes to Otzdarva, JRM, Hens, and Ayrun.</li>
      <li>You may use any offering other than event offerings.</li>
      <li>All games must be played with Sansky, Cedes, Shelly &amp; Dojer.</li>
      <li>You may only prestige if the survivor is alive. You cannot use the Shrine to unlock perks.</li>
      <li>The challenge is succeeded when every group member is at Iridescent I simultaneously.</li>
      <li>The survivor pool (39 survivors) is shared between the group; when a survivor dies in-game, it is lost for everyone.</li>
      <li>You must play on a brand-new Dead by Daylight account (Steam Family Share for DLCs).</li>
      <li>Each person must use a unique survivor. The challenge is lost when there are not enough unique survivors for the group.</li>
      <li>All Bloodpoints must be earned playing Survivor. Any Bloodpoints earned must be used to level up the survivor they were earned with.</li>
      <li>You’re only allowed to use an item plundered from the previous trial—you cannot alter it in the loadout menu (unless permanently discarding it).</li>
      <li>If you lose a survivor, any remaining Bloodpoints must be spent on a Killer or already-dead survivor. While “wasting” these Bloodpoints, you may not prestige the character.</li>
      <li>If a survivor is killed by a cheater, that death won’t be counted. On clear instances of stream-sniping, the group will decide whether to count or ignore the death.</li>
      <li>You cannot use the starting login bonus (50 K), Tutorial, Shrine, event offerings, or store codes to gain Bloodpoints. You may complete the Tutorial to unlock David King but must waste those Bloodpoints on a Killer or already-dead survivor. Following the quest system rework, bloodpoints automatically given to survivors through quests may be used. </li>
